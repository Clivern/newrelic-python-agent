- Add API for cross application tracing of non-HTTP external services

  A new API is now exposed for implementing cross application tracing in custom
  instrumentation of non-HTTP transport libraries. For usage of this API see
  https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/cross-application-tracing

- Add instrumentation for gRPC client calls

  Outbound gRPC requests will now show up in APM under the External Services
  tab and in transaction traces.

- Fixes erroneous recording of TastyPie `NotFound` exceptions

  When a TastyPie API view raised a `NotFound` exception resulting in a 404
  response, the agent may have erroneously recorded the exception. This has now
  been fixed.
