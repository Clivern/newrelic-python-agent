    # from the root, we would send "GET / HTTP/1.1".

    # of an absolute path, i.e. "http://127.0.0.1:8989/" instead of "/". note
    # that this should only be the case when we're actually *using* this proxy.
    # so, if, for example, we're configuring a proxy on the nonexistant
    # "dummy://" protocol then we shouldn't be using the absolute uri in the
    # request-line
