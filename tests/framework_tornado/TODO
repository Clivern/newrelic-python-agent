* The tornado.wsgi.WSGIApplication() object should be automatically wrapped
  as WSGI application entrypoint so it doesn't need to be manually wrapped
  or always used with WSGI server/container that wraps it.

* When using WSGIContainer() to wrap a WSGI application in a mixed async
  application, the web transaction gets named after the URL. Most likely
  this is because not yet using framework mode for name transaction.
