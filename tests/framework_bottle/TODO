TODO
----

* Need to add a framework definition for bottle so that name after WGSI
  application entry point by default. At the moment a request against a
  non existent URL gets passed through as raw URL and so could get metric
  explosion.

* If custom error handlers are specified, such as for 404 in particular,
  then web transaction should be named after that if appropriate.

* Currently instrumentation ignores HTTPResponse and HTTPError with HTTPError
  deriving from HTTPResponse. Needs to be more selective and not ignore all
  HTTPError exceptions and restrict to typical subset such as not found
  and redirects.

* Need a test example for RouteReset exceptions.

* Need tests for all the template engines supported.

* Need to look at Werkzeug plugin and how that affects what exceptions need
  to be ignored as it is possible to raise Werkzeug exceptions to do the
  same thing as bottle exceptions.
