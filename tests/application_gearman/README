TESTING
-------

To test you will need to have the 'gearmand' server installed. This is
distinct from the Python client and worker packages. The easiest way is to
install 'gearman' using 'brew'.

Before running the actual test, first run 'gearmand' in a separate window:

    /usr/local/sbin/gearmand --verbose DEBUG --port 4730

Then run 'tox' as usual.

You can also run a second 'gearmand' server instance as:

    /usr/local/sbin/gearmand --verbose DEBUG --port 4731

In this case, the client will distribute tasks across the servers, with
workers also pulling from both servers. This multi server arrangement
is part of its redundancy and failover support.

All results are recorded as background tasks under 'Function' and 'Gearman'
categories. The first being client side and the latter server side.

Note that gearman currently does not support Python 3.X and so only tests
for Python 2.X and pypy are run.
