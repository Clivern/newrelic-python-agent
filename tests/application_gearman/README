TESTING
-------

To test you will need to have the 'gearman' server installed. This is
distinct from the Python client and worker packages. The easiest way is
to install 'gearman' using 'brew'.

Before running the actual test, first run in a separate window:

    /usr/local/sbin/gearmand --verbose DEBUG

Then run 'tox' as usual.

All results are recorded as background tasks under 'Function' and 'Gearman'
categories. The first being client side and the latter server side.

Note that gearman currently does not support Python 3.X and so only tests
for Python 2.X and pypy are run.
