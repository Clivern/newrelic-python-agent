Requirements
============

Host system must have the following:

1. GCC/G++. G++ is required for doing Python build on some systems.

2. Python. Preferably Python 2.5 or later. This is only use to bootstrap the
   build process. Specifically used by 'buildout' package used to coordinate
   the builds.
